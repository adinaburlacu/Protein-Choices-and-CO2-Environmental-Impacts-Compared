# Protein Choices and CO2 Environmental Impacts Compared


During my data analytics bootcamp, I undertook a comprehensive project centered around the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions generated throughout the lifecycle of various protein production methods. This initiative involved a broad analysis of global protein preferences, shedding light on which nations lean towards plant-based versus animal-based protein consumption.

### Grams of animal-based protein consumed per day per capita from 1960 to 2020

### Product clustering - Agrybalise dataset 

Regarding the Agrybalise dataset encompasses an extensive array of data concerning different facets of agricultural and food production, providing insights into environmental impacts, sustainability, and other correlated metrics. 


Utilizing this dataset, I systematically organized protein products into four distinct clusters, each delineated by their Environmental CO2 (ECO) scores. These scores are in a range starting from level 1, indicating minimal environmental impact, to level 4, which signifies a substantial ecological footprint.

### ECO Score indicators

### ECO Score App
To bring clarity to the analysis, I developed an intuitive application. Users can input a specific protein source and corresponding product, and in return, receive the associated ECO score. This interactive tool also offers in-depth insights into the product's lifecycle and the quantity of emissions it contributes over its entire life.
